### ** Outlier Detection with Mixture Models** (`outlier-detection-mixture-models/README.md`)


# Outlier Detection Using Mixture Models

## Overview
This project explores the use of **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)** for detecting outliers in a dataset. By leveraging **unsupervised learning**, we cluster data points and identify anomalies that significantly deviate from normal distribution patterns.

## Key Features
- **Mixture Model-Based Outlier Detection**: Uses **Gaussian Mixture Models** (GMM) to learn the underlying distribution.
- **KMeans Clustering for Initialization**: Improves convergence.
- **Visualization**: Highlights detected outliers in a density plot.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently processes large datasets.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `sklearn`

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-portfolio.git
