# Customer Segmentation Using UMAP & HDBSCAN

## Overview
This project applies **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** and **HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** for **customer segmentation**. These advanced clustering techniques allow for more flexible and meaningful segmentation of high-dimensional data.

## Key Features
- **Dimensionality Reduction with UMAP**: Captures key features while preserving relationships.
- **Density-Based Clustering with HDBSCAN**: Automatically determines the number of clusters.
- **Visualization of Customer Groups**: Plots customer segments in a lower-dimensional space.
- **Real-World Applications**: Useful for **marketing, churn analysis, and personalization**.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `umap-learn`
- `hdbscan`
- `sklearn`
